Masterâ€™s Thesis

### Abstract

The aim of the study is to investigate the complex mechanisms of speech perception and ultimately decode the electrical changes in the brain to produce speech.

I attempt to decode heard speech from intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) data using deep learning methods.

I set out with the goal to aid in the advancement of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for speech synthesis, and I also hoped to provide an additional perspective on the cognitive processes of speech perception.

The approach I used in this research was novel, as it diverged from the conventional focus on speech production and instead chose to investigate neural representations of perceived speech. This angle opened up a complex perspective, potentially allowing for the study of more sophisticated neural patterns. Leveraging the power of deep learning models, my research aimed to establish a connection between these intricate neural activities and the corresponding speech sounds.

Despite my approach not having achieved a breakthrough yet, promising results have been obtained, particularly in identifying neural patterns related to speech perception. While precise speech synthesis from neural activity remains a challenge, correlations observed between the original and decoded signals reveal a strong link between the cognitive imprints of speaking and listening.

Therefore, my research indicates progress in the field of BCIs by shedding light on the vast potential of decoding neural activity during speech perception, which could be crucial in creating a more naturalistic, communication-focused BCI system.
